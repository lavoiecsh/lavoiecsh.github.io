Another year, another advent, more code!

This will be my fourth year attempting the different challenges:

- 2018: completed everything in C#
- 2019: partially completed in Haskell
- 2020: completed everything in C++
- 2021: this will be the year of Rust

Doing code challenges in C++ is a breeze. It's super performant so you can get away with some slight imperfections in your code and still get some ridiculously fast execution times. Newer version syntaxes allow for easier readability and less code writing as well.

Due to lack of time, I didn't want to embark on another functional language challenge as they usually require a lot of knowledge of the language if you want to get some decent performances.

But I still wanted to learn a new language. So I chose Rust.

It's another imperative language similar to C and C++, but with a cleaner syntax.

Some quick tests have shown it has some pretty incredible performances as well, no wonder it's used in operating systems.

I converted some problems from 2019 in Rust [here](https://github.com/lavoiecsh/lavoiecsh.github.io/tree/master/code/advent2019/rust) to get a hang of it.

New solutions will come hopefully each day in [advent2021](https://github.com/lavoiecsh/lavoiecsh.github.io/tree/master/code/advent2021)
