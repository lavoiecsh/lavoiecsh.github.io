December has come around and it's time for the Advent of Code again!

Last year I completed the challenges using C#, TDD, and way to much architecture. I was also creating a blog post each day to track my progress.

This year I challenged myself to use Haskell and not overthink the problems. I won't be creating a blog post each day though, but one every once in a while.

As we're December 2nd, I've already completed 2 challenges and here are my thoughts so far on using Haskell:
- Syntax is increadibly easy and readable
- Thinking in functional gives a good break from day to day OO programming
- Understanding how to interact with Monads is complicated but is becoming easier each day

As with last year, all my code will be available online: https://github.com/lavoiecsh/lavoiecsh.github.io/tree/master/code/advent2019
