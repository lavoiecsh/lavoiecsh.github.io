Small update to announce that my regular posting schedule will be change during the month of december as I will be posting solutions I come up with for the Advent of Code challenge: https://adventofcode.com/.

I have done some of the challenges in the past years, but have never completed the advent during the month of december, so this will be a first for me.

I intend to post my solutions as I go and I will probably use differents languages to implement those solutions. I'm expecting some C#, Javascript, sed/perl mainly, but maybe some F#/Haskell or Python as well.
