This is the first problem that I still haven't an efficient way to solve the second part.

I went with a pretty simple solution for the first part, calculating the next generation by looking up whether each plant is alive or not in the notes. This worked fine for 20 generations.

Scaling this to the second part and it's 50,000,000,000 generations just isn't cutting it. After some tests, my code runs 1,000,000 generations in about 7 seconds. 50 billion generations would take me around 97 hours of computing which is doable but not something I want to run.

I skipped the second part for today and will come back to it later when I have more time or when I have an idea to improve my solution. My remaining ideas are to try to parallelize the computing of a generation or use memoization and check if some sections of the plants have been calculated before.
