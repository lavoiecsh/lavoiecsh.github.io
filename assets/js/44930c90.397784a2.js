Doing Acceptance Test Driven Development makes it easier to integrate automated acceptance tests in your development cycle as you write these first. It also ensures that you don't forget a part of the code needed to implement the new feature. When using Git Flow for managing branches, it's especially powerful as the first thing you do in your new branch will be an acceptance test, and your branch is ready to merge when that acceptance test passes. It should also be noted that this pattern can also be used when fixing bugs by writing a test that follows the expected behaviour of the program (which should fail because there's a bug) and adding tests and code until that test passes (essentially fixing the bug)."))}d.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
