Welcome to my blog.

I'm starting this blog as an opportunity to talk about software development. My objective here is to provide my opinion on different subjects pertaining to software development, and maybe teach you new stuff.

My plan is to write about general development practices as well as more specific C#, dotnet core news. Blog posts should be short and uploaded every week or two at the maximum.

I will also be translating the blog posts in French.
