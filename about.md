My name is SÃ©bastien Lavoie-Courchesne. I'm the software architect for the Catalog domain group at AppDirect. I've been working there since May 2019, first as a developer before becoming a software architect. I work heavily with GraphQL, Kafka, NodeJS and TypeScript.

I like architecture, programming, clean code and teaching stuff to other people, hence this blog.

I delve into best practices, litterature reviews and technology opinions.

This is also a place for me to put down some updates on myself as well as some code challenges I partake in once in a while.
